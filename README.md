Symfony 2 Framework Tutorial
----------------------------

This is a tutorial project where I will be building a PHP Symfony 2 based framework.  The full tutorial was posted by [Fabien Potencier](http://fabien.potencier.org/article/50/create-your-own-framework-on-top-of-the-symfony2-components-part-1).  Since it is a tutorial, the product should not be used in production.

Development
-----------
This repository is following the branching technique described in [this blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), and the semantic version set out on the [Semantic Versioning Website](http://semver.org/).

This tool uses [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to install the project specific libraries.

Questions or problems? Please post them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/codemis/symfony_2_framework_tutorial/issues). You can contribute changes by forking the project and submitting a pull request.
